Issues
Nothing appears onscreen when you create a comment
When you use multiselect and selectedPan(), rectangles sometimes don't pan along with the rest of the objects (they move around more). Edit: this can be a circle too. It's usually the third or so object added. Other objects that are added after that might pan correctly.
Nothing happens to selected objects when you rotate
selectedPan() didn't work after multiple other functions are called (created a bunch of shapes, tested deleteSelected(), restoreLast(), and clear())
Paste() doesn't paste the object selected
setThickness creates a border around drawableCanvas (border is black, even if setBorderColor() is set to a different color)
restoreLast() doesn't restore last object deleted (whether it was deleteSelected() or deleteLast())
exportAs() doesn't seem to do anything
importImage doesn't work. I put the image in multiple folders (main PollyPaint folder, src, src->backend) and it still didn't run. I passed the argument "grayscrunchie", ".png" and got the error message "Could not find a method to load grayscrunchie"

NOTE: Could not find a way to test createAt(). You have to pass in a PollyObject to test this, and I don't know how to pass in a separate PollyObject. (createShape() runs createAt(), so I can't use it for testing). I'll keep thinking on how to possibly do this.

Successful tests run
Re-center works if you zoom in and if you zoom out
Grid spacing works for positive ints of different sizes
Canvaspan pans canvas correctly
You can create a circle, shape, and textbox
setFillColor() and setBorderColor() work when creating new shapes
Selectedpan() pans shapes selected properly
Singleselect() allows you to select one shape
deleteSelected() works for singleSelect() and multiSelect()
p clears all objects onscreen (not just ones selected)
deleteLast() works to delete objects in the order they were created
setThickness() works
withinBounds() accurately determines if mouse position is in bounds, even if the canvas is zoomed or paned
