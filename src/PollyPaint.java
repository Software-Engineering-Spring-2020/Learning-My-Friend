/**
 *<h1> PollyPaint </h1>
 * This is our primary class. Our `main` method is stored here. When launching the program this is what launches.
 *
 * This is our `sketch` and it is broken into five methods.
 * <h4>main</h4>
 * 	This is called first and passes any arguments to PApplets.
 * <h4>settings</h4>
 *  "The settings() function is necessary when using Processing code outside of the Processing Development Environment (PDE).
 *  For example, when using the Eclipse code editor, it's necessary to use settings() to define the size() and smooth() values for a sketch." ~ Processing Docs
 *  Here we enbale smoth() which is anti-aliasing (aa). We can increase this by using smoth(4) for x4 aa, or smoth(8) for x8 aa.
 * <h4>setup</h4>
 * 	Setup runs once at the start of the program. We can build and define things here.
 * <h4>draw</h4>
 *  Draw gets called with the framerate.
 * <h4>controlEvent</h4>
 * 	controEvent is called by `controlP5`. It then passes all events generated by the gui to the handler where it is parsed.
