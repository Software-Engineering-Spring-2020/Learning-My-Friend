Keyboard shortcuts
You can use buttons in PollyPaint. If you would prefer, in many cases, you can use keyboard shortcuts instead of buttons. There are also some functions PollyPaint supports that you can't use buttons for, but you can use keyboard shortcuts for.

Keyboard shortcuts (additional features): 
Control z: Delete the last shape created
Control y: Restore the last shape deleted
Control x: Cut elements you have selected (delete where the shape used to be. Then you have to paste it somewhere new)

>: Increase thickness of shape borders for when you create new shapes
{: Decrease the spacing of the grid
}: Increase the spacing of the grid
