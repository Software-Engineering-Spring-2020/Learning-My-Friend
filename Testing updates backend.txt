Issues
Pasting (even after copying) doesn't seem to work
duplicateSelected() doesn't seem to work 
Bounding boxes don't line up fully with freeDrawn shapes. Though, it seems like if you click on the dot, you can select the freeDrawn shapes. If we can't get the bounding boxes to line up fully, we can  make a note in the ReadMe to click the dot.

More minor issues
Bounding boxes don't maintain perfect relative size to an object if you scale it. If the shapes gets very big, the bounding box is significantly larger. Sometimes when an object changes size, though rarely, the bounding box can be smaller than the object.
If you make resize an object to make it smaller, if you make it so small that it disappears, resizing it to make it smaller ends up resizing it to make it larger. (However, you can resize an object to take up the entire screen, and it doesn't get any smaller)

Notes/design choices
You can't create a comment until toggleComments is turned on (even after you turn on comments, if you created a comment before they were toggled on, it won't show)

Misc notes (weird edge cases probably due to to program lagging):
One time, when I selected text, then a circle, then a rectangle, nothing rotated. This may have been due to the program lagging but I still wanted to note it.
Not really a specific issue, but sometimes it takes a while for the program to load/create rectangles/allow you to select. I noticed this especially with rotate.

Testing limitation / to-do notes: 
Could not find a way to test createAt(). You have to pass in a PollyObject to test this, and I don't know how to pass in a separate PollyObject. (createShape() runs createAt(), so I can't use it for testing). I'll keep thinking on how to possibly do this.
getSelectedFillColor() and getSelectedBorderColor() is returning references (like I@616f32d1). I'll probably test how these functions work in the holistic systems test.

Successful tests run
Re-center works if you zoom in and if you zoom out
Grid spacing works for positive ints of different sizes
Canvaspan pans canvas correctly
You can create a circle, shape, and textbox
setFillColor() and setBorderColor() work when creating new shapes
Selectedpan() pans shapes selected properly
Singleselect() allows you to select one shape
deleteSelected() works for singleSelect() and multiSelect()
p clears all objects onscreen (not just ones selected)
deleteLast() works to delete objects in the order they were created
setThickness() works
withinBounds() accurately determines if mouse position is in bounds, even if the canvas is zoomed or paned
Objects seem to be rotating correctly. Multiple objects that are selected can be rotated. Rotation works on different areas of the screen.
restoreLast() restores objects in the order they were deleted (even if you use deleteSelected() or clear())
exportAs() saves image in the bin folder
toggleGrid() works with negative numbers. The code seems to just ignore the negative.
setFillColor() works with negative numbers and numbers over 255. The code seems to just ignore the negative numbers passed and keep the color as black.
setBorderColor() works with negative numbers and numbers over 255.
setThickness() works with negative numbers.
rotate() works with negative numbers and numbers over 360.
Comments are created when correctly toggled.
Text rotates
Multiselect and panning seems to work without any shapes panning differently
Multiselect with rotating seems to work (objects rotate the same amount, based on the number input, without one shape rotating more or less)
setSelectedFillColor() and setSelectedBoarderColor() worked for multiselected shapes
getSelectedFillColor() and setSelectedBoarderColor() seem to work for multiselected shapes (I printed to the console, but it gave me reference points instead of numbers, so I can't veryify 100%). See issues for getSelectedFillColor(). 
freeDraw() accurately follows the mouse of the user. The dot is shown when you lift the mouse, so freeDraw() shapes are created correctly.
toggleComments() works
createPollyGon() connects dots in the order you clicked them
freeDraw() works with setThickness() and setBoarderColor(). 
I passed in five values for setSelectedFillColor() and two for setSelectedBoarderColor(). The console showed errors, but the program didn't crash, and set a color for the fill/border.
Bounding boxes work with shapes that have a large thicknesses 
Bounding boxes remain after you clear, but come back when you click somewhere else on the canvas
resizeSelected() makes objects bigger if you pass in a positive float, and it makes them smaller if you pass in a negative float
createCurve() works and creates smooth curves
Grouping works: even if you click away, clicking one object selects another object in the group.
Ungrouping works: when you click away, clicking on one object formerly in the group doesn't affect the other object formerly in the group
You can scale an object to be large enough to fill the entire screen
